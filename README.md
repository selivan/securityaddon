## API
When we need to use it?
> If you app supported other trigers, need crypt files before send or you want to make addon - you are welcome!

What can api do?
- Delete files
- Crypt files/folders
- Decrypt files/folders

How to?
3 modes:
> delete, crypt, decrypt

You need send to api wth extras:  mode, path to folder or files(s) (as arraylist) and for last 2 modes - password.
Example:
``` Java
//List with pass
public ArrayList<String> path = new ArrayList<String>();
path.add("/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera/"); //adding files or folders
Intent intent = new Intent();
        intent.setClassName("com.huntmix.secbutton","com.huntmix.secbutton.ApiCall");
        intent.putExtra("mode","decrypt");
        intent.putExtra("pass","1111111111111111");
        intent.putStringArrayListExtra("path",path);
        startActivity(intent); //launching
```
How it works you can see in Api.java
# Own triggers
Command line

``` Bash
am start -n com.huntmix.secbutton/.Deleter --activity-no-history
```
From your app
``` Java
Intent intent = new Intent();
        intent.setClassName("com.huntmix.secbutton","com.huntmix.secbutton.Deleter");
        startActivity(intent);
```
With this you can run app from taskers, smart watches, voice commands and other!
